# Stacks:

Stack is a Data Structure that follows the first in last last out, FILO or LIFO, principle.

**Considering the following operations:**

- push(1)
- push(2)
- push(3)
- push(4)
- pop()
- pop()
- size()

For the above set of Instructions the following are returned in the given order:

- [1] ==> [2,1] ==> [3,2,1] ==> [4,3,2,1]  *Index 0 is the top element in every iteration of the given expression* 
- [4,3,2,1] ==> [3,2,1]

Size of the stack at the end of all operations will be **3**

*The **top** or **peek** function allows us to see the topmost or last inserted element of the stack*
