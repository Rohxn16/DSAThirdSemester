# Binary Trees

A binary tree is a data structure where a node can have a maximum of 2
children nodes, namely the left and right nodes. The reason each node can
have a maximum of 2 child nodes has certain benifits like:

- Algorithms like traversing, searching, insertion and deletion becomes
   faster.

- Keeps data sorted in a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, keeping the data
    organized and improving efficiency of searching algorithms.

- Balancing trees is easier to do with a limited number of children nodes,
    with **AVL Trees** for example.

- Binary Trees can be represented as arrays (using traversal methods like
    **pre-order, post-order and in-order** traversal methods, which makes
    trees much more memory efficient.

## Binary Trees v/s Arrays v/s Linked Lists

- Arrays are useful when the number of elements that are gonna be stored in
  known, but in case it is unknown there might be an underflow or a overflow of
  memory.
- Linked Lists are fast for insertions and deletion but traversal is usually
  costly.
- Binary trees : Binary trees overcomes both of the above mentioned shortcomings with some of it's variations like BSTs and AVL trees.
